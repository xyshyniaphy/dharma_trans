# Architecture of Input.tsx

## 1. Component Overview
`Input.tsx` is a core React functional component in the Darma Trans application. It serves as the primary user interface for entering text, initiating translations, and viewing the results. Its main responsibilities include managing the user input field, handling the translation process across multiple selected models, and displaying the ongoing and completed translations via child components.

Key features include:
- An auto-growing textarea for user input to accommodate varying text lengths.
- A "清空" (Clear) button to quickly clear the input text.
- A "翻译" (Translate) button and keyboard shortcuts (`Enter` to translate, `Ctrl+Enter` for a new line) to trigger the translation workflow.
- An instruction label to inform users about the keyboard shortcuts.
- Integration with a `ModelSelector` component, allowing users to see which models are active.
- A dedicated scrollable area to display translation results rendered by the `TranslateItems` component.

## 2. Props
The component accepts the following props, which are primarily callbacks to manage the application's state:
- `addTranslationToTopic: (translation: Translation) => Promise<void>`: A function passed to the `useTranslatorExe` hook to add a newly completed translation to the central state.
- `deleteTranslation: (translationId: string) => Promise<void>`: A callback function passed down to the `TranslateItems` component to handle the deletion of a specific translation.
- `updateTranslationExpansion: (translateId: string, isExpanded: boolean) => void`: A callback passed down to `TranslateItems` to toggle the visibility of the detailed "thinking" process for a translation item.

## 3. State Management and Hooks
`Input.tsx` relies heavily on custom hooks and Recoil for a clean separation of concerns and to interact with global application state.

- **`useTranslatorExe()`**: A custom hook that provides the `startTranslate` function. This hook encapsulates the logic for executing a single translation request.
- **`useDTConfig()`**: A custom hook that provides access to the global configuration object (`config`), which contains settings like the list of `selectedModels`.
- **`useState<string>('')`**: Manages the local `inputText` state for the controlled `textarea` component.
- **`useModelsState()`**: A custom hook that supplies the full list of available `models`.
- **`useRef<HTMLTextAreaElement>(null)`**: A `textareaRef` is attached to the `textarea` element to allow direct DOM access, specifically for calculating its `scrollHeight` to enable the auto-grow feature.
- **`useTranslatorStatus()`**: A custom hook that returns the `updateStatus` function, allowing the component to modify the global translator status (e.g., setting `isProcessing` to `true` and updating the status message).
- **`useEffect()`**: This hook is dedicated to the auto-growing textarea functionality. It listens for changes to `inputText` and adjusts the textarea's height dynamically based on its content.

## 4. Key Functionalities

### a. Auto-Growing Textarea
- The `useEffect` hook monitors the `inputText` state.
- When the text changes, it resets the textarea's height to `auto`, then sets it to the element's `scrollHeight`. This creates a seamless auto-resize effect, improving user experience.

### b. Keyboard-driven Interaction (`handleKeyDown` function)
- The component captures `onKeyDown` events in the textarea.
- **`Enter`**: Triggers the `processText` function to start translation, preventing the default newline action.
- **`Ctrl+Enter`**: Manually inserts a newline character (`\n`) into the `inputText` state at the current cursor position, allowing for multi-line input. It programmatically updates the cursor position to ensure a smooth user experience.

### c. Text Processing (`processText` function)
This asynchronous function is the heart of the component's logic and is triggered by the "翻译" button or the `Enter` key.
1.  **Validation**: It first checks if any models have been selected in the global configuration and if the `inputText` is not empty. If not, it alerts the user or returns early.
2.  **State Management**: It captures the `inputText` and immediately clears the textarea for a responsive feel. It then updates the global status to "翻译中" (Translating) and sets `isProcessing` to `true`.
3.  **Batch Processing**: It generates a unique `transBatchId` using the current timestamp. This ID is assigned to all translations generated from the single click, allowing them to be grouped visually in the UI.
4.  **Data Fetching**: It calls the `fetchTransData()` utility function once to retrieve any necessary data (like few-shot examples or dictionaries) before starting the translations.
5.  **Translation Loop**: It iterates through the `config.selectedModels` array. For each model ID, it:
    - Finds the corresponding model object from the `models` list.
    - Generates a `uniqueTranslateId` for the individual translation instance.
    - Calls the `startTranslate` function with all necessary parameters, including the input text, the model object, and the fetched `transData`.
6.  **Error Handling**: The entire process is wrapped in a `try...catch...finally` block. If an error occurs, it's logged, and the status is updated. The `finally` block ensures that the `isProcessing` state is always reset to `false`, preventing the UI from getting stuck in a loading state.

## 5. Component Relationships
- **Parent Component**: `Input.tsx` is designed to be rendered within a higher-level component, such as `App.tsx`, which provides the necessary callback props for state manipulation.
- **Child Components**:
    - **`ModelSelector`**: This component is rendered to display the model selection UI. It likely consumes the same global configuration state (`useDTConfig`) to display the selected models.
    - **`TranslateItems`**: This component is responsible for rendering the list of translations. `Input.tsx` passes the `deleteTranslation` and `updateTranslationExpansion` props down to it.
- **Shared State**: The component is a heavy consumer of global state managed by Recoil, accessed via custom hooks. This allows it to remain decoupled from other components while sharing state like application configuration (`useDTConfig`), translator status (`useTranslatorStatus`), and the list of available models (`useModelsState`).
