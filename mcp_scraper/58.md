# Study Notes | *A Commentary on the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra* - Lesson 58

## I. Outline Coordinates

This lesson continues from the previous one, which discussed how to act after observing the state of our body, speech, and mind. Firstly, we must cease non-virtuous actions, abandon attachment and distraction, eliminate meaningless activities, and eradicate actions driven by afflictions. Through brief and detailed explanations, it elaborates on the need to eliminate the 27 types of irrational thoughts driven by afflictions such as greed and anger. If we discover such mindsets within ourselves, we must immediately counteract them with mindfulness and awareness. This lesson summarizes these teachings.

Having understood the cessation of non-virtuous actions, it then instructs on engaging in virtuous deeds. We should cultivate eight virtuous mindsets, and in the process of practice, it is impossible to satisfy everyone's wishes. However, we must not grow weary but instead treat sentient beings with a compassionate heart. For the sake of self-benefit and the benefit of others, we should engage in actions free from wrongdoing and view all endeavors as illusory, like a dream, to safeguard this precious Bodhicitta.

This lesson uses four verses to elaborate on two main themes: firstly, summarizing the need to counteract defiled and meaningless thoughts with mindfulness and awareness; secondly, in daily life, we should practice eight virtuous deeds.

1. We must constantly observe whether our mindset is tainted by the 27 types of irrational thoughts or engrossed in meaningless pursuits. Upon discovery, we must immediately counteract them with mindfulness and awareness, persistently safeguarding this precious Bodhicitta. (See Verse 1 for details)

2. As practitioners of the Mahayana path, we must first eliminate the 27 afflictions and then cultivate eight virtuous mindsets. (See Verse 2 for details)

3. The minds of ordinary, ignorant beings are often discordant and hard to satisfy fully. We should not grow weary because of this but recognize that they are driven by afflictions and not in control of themselves. Reflecting thus, we should treat them with even greater compassion. (See Verse 3 for details)

4. For the benefit of ourselves and all sentient beings, we should engage in actions free from wrongdoing. Furthermore, we should view all actions as illusory, without arrogance, and constantly safeguard this Bodhicitta. (See Verse 4 for details)

## II. Verse 1: Observe This Defiled Mind, Fond of Meaningless Actions, Know It and Counteract It, Persistently Safeguard This Intention

### Outline Analysis

In the previous lesson, we learned that when the 27 types of irrational thoughts such as greed and anger arise, we must restrain ourselves with mindfulness and awareness, remaining unmoved like a great tree. This verse summarizes that we must constantly observe this defiled mind and meaningless thoughts, counteracting the afflictions in our continuum with mindfulness and awareness. Only in this way can we safeguard this Bodhicitta.

### Textual Explanation

We should observe whether a defiled mindset or a tendency towards meaningless actions has arisen. If it has, the courageous Bodhisattva must immediately counteract it, not leaning towards self-interest but steadfastly upholding this Bodhicitta. (*A Commentary on the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra: Ocean of True Meaning*)

### Key Points and Difficulties of This Verse

#### 1. Grasping Two Points to Safeguard Bodhicitta

- **Awareness of Defiled Mind**: As practitioners, we must always observe our three doors, especially our mindset. If afflictions arise in our continuum, we must recognize their harm and immediately apply antidotes to stop them. For instance, counteract anger with compassion, greed with contemplation of impurity, ignorance with the realization of dependent origination and emptiness, jealousy with equanimity or self-other exchange, and arrogance with the destruction of self-grasping.

- **Counteracting Distraction and Meaningless Thoughts with Mindfulness and Awareness**: When we engage in distracted actions like casually digging the ground or cutting grass, speaking idle words, or doing meaningless things, we must remind ourselves, "I am someone who has generated Bodhicitta; what use is there in doing these trivial things?" Using mindfulness and awareness to counteract a muddled, aimless mindset is extremely important.

#### 2. Reprimanding Unwholesome Mindsets

- Some people often think, "When can I rest? I want to relax properly."
- This is a very unwholesome mindset. As someone who has generated Bodhicitta, we should not constantly think of our own happiness. Although ordinary beings may occasionally have such thoughts, we must immediately recognize, acknowledge, and counteract them.
- Since our body, speech, and mind have been entirely dedicated to sentient beings, we should not have personal time or space. Until sentient beings are liberated, the steps of benefiting others must not cease.
- **Conclusion**: At present, studying, contemplating, and practicing the Dharma is beneficial to sentient beings. During this process, if laziness or slackness arises, or if we wish to engage in meaningless activities, we must immediately remind ourselves not to act this way. Our mindset must change, and all meaningless actions must be abandoned.

#### 3. Practicing According to Teachings

- **Scriptural Evidence**: The *Secret Vast Sutra* states: "Practitioners must protect their own body. How to protect the body? By ceasing actions harmful to sentient beings. How to cease harmful actions? By first eliminating meaningless activities."
- **Practice**:
  - Those who have generated Bodhicitta must observe themselves in all activities—walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—asking, "Does this action benefit sentient beings? Does it benefit my liberation?"
  - This question must be considered first, rather than focusing on personal family or physical well-being. Otherwise, one is not a Mahayana practitioner.
  - Therefore, everyone must "persistently safeguard this intention" and skillfully protect this Bodhicitta.

#### 4. Habituation Is Crucial

- A Tibetan proverb says, "The mindset at night while sleeping is gone by morning."
- Thus, during the process of studying and contemplating, frequent habituation is very important. This habit must never be lost; otherwise, over time, the original mindset will become vague, diluted, and not necessarily firm.
- The stability of the Bodhicitta vow also requires long-term study and habituation. To make the Bodhicitta vow extremely firm, one must first have unwavering faith. To have such faith, long-term study and contemplation are prerequisites, as they dispel doubts, generate certainty, and enhance faith.

#### 5. Teachings from the Guru

- Studying the Dharma must be done systematically over a long period with patience.
- As a Dharma student, merely taking a Dharma name is not enough. If one has taken refuge for over a decade yet does not understand basic cause and effect, what use is a name?
- For monastics, if only the body has renounced while the mind has not, they are not true practitioners.
- Therefore, the only method for practitioners is to study for over ten years. This is the experience derived from the long-term study of the masters, and I hope every Buddhist deeply remembers this and truly keeps it in mind.

#### 6. What to Abandon and What to Adopt

- **To Abandon**: Some people study for a few months or attend a few classes and think they have become practitioners. This is absolutely unacceptable.
- **To Adopt**: Buddhist knowledge is vast like the ocean, profound and extensive. To master this knowledge and become a true practitioner, at least ten years are required.

#### 7. Learning Requires the Right Attitude

- **Dispelling Incorrect Views**: Some think, "The Guru says Bodhicitta is very important and must not be abandoned, so I won't study the *Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra* and will just practice at home."
- If one abandons studying the *Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra* and practices Bodhicitta at home, most can only sustain it for a month; very few can persist. Learning requires the right attitude, which must be clear; otherwise, the resolve for the path will regress.
- Using the analogy of the growth of a one-year-old versus a five-year-old child, the Guru hopes everyone can engage in long-term study and contemplation to counteract meaningless and defiled thoughts, thereby perfectly safeguarding Bodhicitta.

#### 8. Summary

- As practitioners, we must frequently observe whether our actions constitute breaking precepts, committing wrongs, or are meaningless.
- According to the teachings of Shantideva, if we have done something wrong, we should feel shame and guilt and immediately repent.
- If our actions are in accordance with the Dharma and all deeds are virtuous, no matter how tired or painful it is, living in this world is meaningful. This point must be remembered!

## III. Verse 2: Profound Faith, Extreme Certainty, Steadfastness, Reverence with Politeness, Shame, Fear of Cause and Effect, Tranquility, and Diligent Bestowal of Joy

### Outline Analysis

The previous verse summarized that when afflictions arise, one must counteract them with mindfulness and awareness to perfectly safeguard Bodhicitta. This verse discusses the eight aspects to practice in daily life.

### Textual Explanation

Constantly maintain unwavering faith, make extremely firm vows to perform virtuous deeds, rejoice in the merits of virtuous actions, remain steadfast even in difficulties without regressing, hold a reverent mind and pay homage through body and other means. Be vigilant against unwholesome actions with shame and guilt, fear wrongdoing, be cautious of cause and effect, guard the sense doors, thereby achieving tranquil and gentle demeanor, and strive to bring joy to other sentient beings. (*A Commentary on the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra: Ocean of True Meaning*)

### Key Points and Difficulties of This Verse

#### 1. Cultivating Eight Virtuous Mindsets

- **Profound Faith**:
  - **Positive Aspect**: Have unwavering faith in the Three Jewels, cause and effect, the Four Noble Truths, and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.
  - **Negative Aspect**: Without faith, one will not enter the true path, and即便 entered, practice will not succeed.
  - **Conclusion**: Faith is the source of all merits, the mother of all virtues. Faith can be observed through a person's words and actions.

- **Extreme Certainty**:
  - From the perspective of view, this is called "faith of conviction." It means having unwavering correct understanding of the knowledge one has learned, not merely following others' words, but generating a true certainty from the depths of the heart about the existence of past and future lives, the inconceivable merits of the Three Jewels, etc., eliminating wrong views, doubts, and irrational thoughts.
  - If one studies the Dharma without a stable correct view, nothing learned will be reliable.

- **Steadfastness**:
  - Faith and view must be stable. One should not believe in one teaching today and another tomorrow, or have faith in one Guru today and follow another tomorrow.
  - A person must be steady; only then can they be reliable in all endeavors and have the opportunity for accomplishment in practice.

- **Reverence with Politeness**:
  - Have reverence for the Dharma, the Guru, and the Three Jewels; all merits are obtained through reverence. In the presence of the Three Jewels, with physical prostrations, respectful speech, and a reverent mind, the blessings of the Guru and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be easily received.
  - Towards everyone around us, we should regard them as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Whether speaking or acting, we should be courteous and respectful.

- **Shame**:
  - If one lacks shame, nothing can be accomplished successfully.
  - However, if one possesses this virtue, as stated in the *Teachings on Two Disciplines*, the Dharma protectors will also guard you.
  - **Anecdote**: In the *Memoirs of Shadow and Dust*, Zen Master Miaogao sat in meditation on the edge of a cliff and was saved by Dharma protectors.
    - **Explanation**: If arrogance arises in one's continuum, it obstructs practice, but if shame arises and one repents for misdeeds, it is a great act in the eyes of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Dharma protectors.
    - **Instruction**: As ordinary beings, it may be difficult to avoid all faults, but at least one must know shame and guilt.

- **Fear of Cause and Effect**:
  - Cause and effect are infallible. Fearing the creation of negative karma and falling into lower realms, one should act with caution, as if walking on thin ice.
  - **Teaching**: Khenpo Yunga once said, "If someone thinks they have realized enlightenment and thus do not fear cause and effect, this precisely shows they have not realized it."
  - True realizers of emptiness, as Padmasambhava said, have higher views but are even more meticulous in discerning cause and effect.
  - **Reprimand**: Criticizing the erroneous behavior of some in the modern world who claim to be enlightened and thus do not practice properly.
  - **Instruction**: True realizers would never utter such words.
  - **Admonition**: Everyone must be cautious about cause and effect; only then are they true practitioners.

- **Tranquility**:
  - **Physical Tranquility**: Observable through walking and demeanor (not rushing around, sitting quietly at home).
  - **Verbal Tranquility**: Felt through language and tone (not boasting, expressing simply to convey inner state).
  - **Mental Tranquility**: The mind does not wander aimlessly, often abiding in a state aligned with the Dharma.

- **Diligent Bestowal of Joy**:
  - Strive to benefit sentient beings, bringing joy to their hearts.
  - A person with true Bodhicitta has little attachment to personal happiness and constantly seeks ways to help and benefit sentient beings. For the sake of even one being, if a moment of virtuous thought arises, they are willing to spend much time to act on it.
  - Rejoice in and emulate the efforts of Dharma teachers who, for the sake of propagating the Dharma and benefiting beings, are physically and mentally busy without personal time or space. However, relying solely on teachers has limited impact; we all need to contribute together to support this cause.
  - **Dispelling Doubt**: Is it enough to just practice well in a quiet place?
    - **Answer**: To truly engage in altruistic activities, one must interact with many people and use modern technology skillfully to let more people understand the Dharma.

#### 2. Summary

- Always think of benefiting sentient beings, not just personal happiness.
- The eight virtuous deeds—faith, correct view, steadfastness, reverence, shame and guilt, fear of cause and effect, tranquility, and benefiting beings—are crucial for practitioners. One should carefully observe one's continuum and strive to possess these virtues.
- If lacking, one must make every effort to generate and stabilize them in one's continuum.

## IV. Verse 3: The Minds of the Ignorant Are Discordant, Do Not Grow Weary, They Are Driven by Afflictions, Reflect and Cultivate Compassion

### Outline Analysis

The previous verse discussed that practitioners should cultivate eight virtuous mindsets. This verse teaches that in the process of practicing these virtues, one should not grow weary due to sentient beings' afflictions causing discord in opinions, but instead cultivate a compassionate and merciful heart.

### Textual Explanation

The desires of ordinary, ignorant beings are often discordant with one another. Do not grow weary in your heart because of this. Even if they harm you, consider that they are driven by afflictions and not in control of their harmful intentions. Reflecting in this way, you will feel even greater compassion and mercy towards them. (*A Commentary on the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra: Ocean of True Meaning*)

### Key Points and Difficulties of This Verse

#### 1. Sentient Beings Have Vastly Different Capacities

- The Buddha Shakyamuni taught 84,000 Dharma methods to counteract 84,000 afflictions and to liberate beings of various capacities.
- Using the example of distributing prizes, there are always some who are dissatisfied, showing that the inclinations of sentient beings are hard to align, and it is impossible to please everyone.

#### 2. Understanding the Diverse Characters and Mindsets of Beings, Guide Them According to Circumstances

- Using the example of Shariputra once abandoning Bodhicitta to pursue the Hinayana path, it illustrates how difficult it is to guide stubborn beings.
- **Proverbs**:
  - A Tibetan saying: "Thirty people have thirty minds; thirty yaks have sixty horns."
  - A foreign proverb: "There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes."
- **Examples**:
  - Group leader's initiative: If too active, some say you want to be a model; if not active, some say you're useless.
  - Retreat: If active, some say you're always invisible and not sociable; if not active, some say you're always outside and distracted.
  - Guru's teaching: If speaking fast, it's hard to hear; if slow, it's tiring to listen.
  - During the Buddha's time: There were also Devadatta and the monk Sunakshatra who were dissatisfied, and non-Buddhists who slandered.
- **Scriptural Evidence**: According to Nagarjuna's standard in the *Precious Garland*, "Actions created by greed, anger, and ignorance are unwholesome karma." Repeatedly observe your own mind.

#### 3. How to Correctly Recognize and Respond

- No matter how pure a person's actions or how profound their practice, there will always be those who nitpick. Especially when a Dharma teacher's altruistic activities expand, a significant number of people may come forward to slander without reason. This phenomenon occurs frequently.
- If criticism is reasonable, accept it humbly; if it is baseless slander, do not cling to it, and continue to benefit sentient beings with a clear conscience.

#### 4. Why Should We Not Cling to Others' Words?

- **Regarding Oneself**: Cause and effect are infallible; what others say cannot change anything, so there is no need to dwell on it excessively.
- **Regarding Others**: Driven by afflictions, they create verbal karma. We should not harbor anger but instead cultivate compassion. Cause and effect are infallible; the negative karma they create will be borne by themselves. For their irrational actions, not only should we not be angry, but we should transform it into the path and generate great compassion.

#### 5. Scriptural Evidence

- The *Sutra of Questions by Purna* states: "When seeing sentient beings create negative karma, try to advise them, always harbor compassion, and do not develop anger towards them."
- The *Sutra Ornament of Realization* says: "Sentient beings constantly create sins without autonomy. As a wise person, do not cling to this as their fault but consider that they act in delusion unwillingly. Thus, your compassion should grow even stronger."

#### 6. Anecdote

- Patrul Rinpoche used a silver ingot offered by others as a teapot stand, thereby transforming and guiding a thief. This is shown in:
  - Not harboring anger but treating with compassion: "If you harm my disciple, it is as if you harm me. Let him go!"
  - Adapting to the situation and guiding appropriately: "Do not repent to me; just pray to the Three Jewels regularly."

#### 7. Dealing with Ingratitude and Hostility

- **Worldly People**: Unable to endure, they harm each other.
- **Practitioners**:
  - Understand cause and effect; ingratitude and hostility are driven by afflictions. For oneself, it is also due to past karma manifesting as present retribution.
  - Practice patience, remaining unmoved like a tree.
  - Generate compassion, feeling pity for them, and recite Amitabha Buddha's name or mantras of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to dedicate merit to them.
  - As the *Bodhisattva's Way of Life* states: "Those I protect as my own children, even if they see me as an enemy, like a compassionate mother towards a sick child, show even greater love. This is the way of the Bodhisattva."
  - From the perspective of emptiness, view all as dreamlike and illusory.

## V. Verse 4: For Self and Sentient Beings, Engage in Beneficial Actions Without Wrongdoing, Further View as Illusory, Constantly Safeguard This Intention

### Outline Analysis

The previous verse taught that no matter how much effort we make, we cannot satisfy all sentient beings' wishes, but we should not grow weary and instead harbor compassion. This verse explains how a Bodhisattva should act to safeguard this Bodhicitta: on one hand, for self-benefit and the benefit of others, engage in actions free from wrongdoing; on the other hand, view all actions as dreamlike and illusory.

### Textual Explanation

For the benefit of oneself and all sentient beings, engage in actions free from wrongdoing, or as stated in the commentary, from the perspectives of self and others, cultivate shame and guilt. If one acts in this way, then further view all actions as illusory, without arrogance, and constantly safeguard this mind. (*A Commentary on the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra: Ocean of True Meaning*)

### Key Points and Difficulties of This Verse

#### 1. Self-Benefit and Benefiting Others

- Everyone desires benefit, and the greatest benefit is liberation from the ocean of suffering in the three realms of samsara. The ultimate goal of self-liberation from samsara is to benefit sentient beings.
- Therefore, on one hand, one must achieve liberation oneself, and on the other, enable sentient beings to achieve liberation.
- How to achieve liberation for oneself and others? Constantly engage in actions beneficial to sentient beings and refrain from actions harmful to self and others.
  - **Principle**: "Refrain from all evil, practice all good."
  - **Precepts**: Stay away from inherent sins and Buddha-prohibited sins (avoid breaking precepts), as these wrongdoings greatly harm liberation.

#### 2. Dispelling Doubt: If One Can Benefit Beings Without Committing Wrongdoing, Will Arrogance Arise in the Continuum?

- **Answer**: Certainly, it will. At this time, one must counteract arrogance by viewing all as illusory, like a dream.
- In the second chapter of the *Great Perfection: Resting in Illusion*, it specifically discusses the principle of all phenomena being illusory. Practicing as if all is dreamlike and illusory, one ultimately attains an illusory fruition.
- Even for a second-ground Bodhisattva with perfect discipline, if the thought "My precepts are pure" arises, the Buddha said this is a breach of discipline.
- **Conclusion**: Practicing virtuous deeds must not involve arrogance; otherwise, virtuous deeds cannot succeed.

#### 3. Viewing as Illusory

- All good and evil are illusory, without the slightest inherent nature. What is there to be arrogant about?
- Life is like a dream; all past events are merely beautiful memories, leaving nothing else behind.
- The Guru uses personal childhood memories as an example, explaining that things once deeply clung to, when recalled now, hold no attachment.

#### 4. Reflecting Inward

- Life is like a dream, time passes, recalling joys and sorrows feels like another lifetime. Be cautious with the three doors, discern cause and effect, view the world as illusory, and safeguard Bodhicitta.
